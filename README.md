# Luminareware-SQEF-NIST-Evaluation

Luminareware SQEF NIST Evaluation Repository

**Developer**: Luminareware LLC
**Patent Status**: Patent Pending (USPTO Application)

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive test results for Luminareware's SQEF cryptographic random number generation capabilities, submitted for NIST evaluation.

## Key Results Summary

* **Min-Entropy: 7.96-7.99 bits/byte across all configurations (NIST SP 800-90B validated)
* **NIST SP 800-22: All 33 configurations pass (6,204 tests, 98.40%-100% pass rates per configuration)*
* **NIST SP 800-90B: 100% IID compliance (all 33 configurations)
* **Technology**: Software-only implementation achieving hardware-grade randomness
*
