# Security Policy

## Repository Scope

This repository contains NIST validation test results and documentation for Luminareware's SQEF (Simulated Quantum Entropy Fusion) technology. **This repository does not contain executable code or implementation details** - only test outputs, validation data, and documentation.

## Supported Materials

| Material Type | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NIST SP 800-22 Test Results | ✅ Active | Current validation data |
| NIST SP 800-90B Test Results | ✅ Active | Current validation data |
| Test Methodology Documentation | ✅ Active | Current procedures |
| Sample Output Files | ✅ Active | For verification only |
| Historical Test Data | ⚠️ Archived | Reference only |

## Reporting Issues

### What to Report

Since this repository contains test data rather than executable code, relevant issues include:

- **Data Integrity Concerns**: Inconsistencies in test results or validation data
- **Documentation Errors**: Inaccuracies in methodology or technical descriptions
- **Statistical Anomalies**: Unexpected patterns in test outputs
- **Validation Concerns**: Questions about test procedures or results
- **Privacy Issues**: Unintended disclosure of sensitive information

### What NOT to Report

- Implementation vulnerabilities (no implementation is provided)
- Code execution issues (no executable code is included)
- Feature requests for SQEF technology itself

### How to Report

For issues related to test data or documentation:

1. **Public Issues**: For non-sensitive concerns, please open a GitHub Issue
2. **Private Concerns**: For sensitive matters, contact contact@luminareware.com
3. **Cryptographic Review**: For technical cryptographic questions, contact contact@luminareware.com


### Issue Handling Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will confirm receipt of your report
